  Notification small icon for NeedYou.
  Android 5+ renders notification icons as white-on-transparent monochrome.
  Using the launcher adaptive icon causes a solid white blob — this clean
  "N" vector resolves that and looks sharp in the status bar at any size.

      The letter N drawn as two verticals connected by a diagonal:
      Left bar (4,3) → (4,21)
      Diagonal (4,3) → (20,21)
      Right bar (20,3) → (20,21)
      Each stroke is 3dp wide so it reads well at 16–24 dp.
